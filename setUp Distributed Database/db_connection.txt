Database Connection:
Steps:

1. At site: 

	1.1. Turn off the firewall.
	1.2. Get the IPv4 address (XXX.XX.XX.XXX). Note it down.

2. At server: Ping the site from RUN. If you get a successful reply, then everything is perfect.

3. At site:

	3.1. Go to C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\NETWORK\ADMIN\
	3.2. Find listener.ora file.
	3.3. Open listener.ora using NOTEPAD++ and do the following changes.
	3.4. Add the following commands to provide additional SID_LIST under the SID_LIST_LISTENER section (see slide - 6):

		(SID_DESC =
      			(SID_NAME = XE
      			(ORACLE_HOME = C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server)
    		)

	3.5. Add the following commands to provide additional DESCRIPTION_LIST under the LISTENER section (see slide - 6):

		(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = XXX.XX.XX.XXX)(PORT = 1521))

	3.6. Save the changes.
	3.7. Run CMD with the administrative mode.
	3.8. In CMD, run the command lsnrctl stop. If you get a successful message then ok (see slide - 7).
	3.9. Again in CMD, run the command lsnrctl start. If you get a successful message then ok (see slide - 7).

4. At server:

	4.1. Run your sqlplus and log in. Execute the following codes (also provided as conn.sql) to generate a database link with the site:
		
		   drop database link site_link;

			create database link site_link
 			connect to username identified by "password"
			using '(DESCRIPTION =
       				   (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP) (HOST = XXX.XX.XX.XXX) (PORT = 1521)))
      				   (CONNECT_DATA = (SID = XE))
    			       )' ; 
 
	4.2. Now, select/ insert/ delete any data of the site from server using @site_link. For example:

			select * from student@site_link;
